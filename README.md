# Elevator pitch with power words added


Hi my name is Matt, this past summer I successfully graduated with first class honours as a master of chemistry from the university of bath. Throughout the course, I
gained a substantial amount of experience with Python and coding and as I was approaching the end of the course, I found that I
wanted to pursue working in software instead as a potential future career. To cement my passion, in the following months after my
graduation I decided to further improve my skillset in coding by completing courses in web design on freecode camp as well as practice
coding in languages like javascript. When I began my research into the different roles available to me in the tech industry,
I discovered DevOps which I found to be one of the most interesting and intriguing roles I could pursue. The role stood out for me 
as I felt that could not only develop my skills in software development but also gain much deeper understanding of operations further 
broadening my skillset. Furthermore working in DevOps would allow me to be at the forefront of an ever evolving industry 
and the fact that it is still a relatively novel area that is in such high demand further drove my passion and attracted me to 
the role.

# Elevator pitch with power words added


Hi my name is Matt, just this past summer I successfully graduated as a master of chemistry 
with frist class honorous from the university of bath. During my time at univeristy I not only had the opportunity to learn
but I was also able to improve my teamwork and communication skills by working behind the university bar as well as pursue
my currently favourite hobby which is music - playing the electric guitar. I have been playing for the past 2 and a half years
and I am looking forward to keep learning my favourite songs on the guitar. Throughout the course I was able to gain a substantial 
amount of experience in coding specifically in Python during different modules especially in the final year. As I was approaching
the end of the course I found that I wanted to pursue a career within technology instead of chemistry as it interested me far more. 
To cement this decision, in the following months after my graduation, I decided to further my skillset by completing a course in 
web design on freecode camp as well as continue solidifying my knowledge of python. Whilst researching the different roles 
available to me within the tech industry, I discovered DevOps which I found to be one of the most interesting and intriguing roles 
I could pursue. The role stood out for me as I felt that could not only develop my skills in software development and coding but also 
gain much deeper understanding of the operations side of things so how code is deployed and the infrastructure around it thus further
broadening my skillset. Furthermore working in DevOps would allow me to be at the forefront of an ever evolving industry and the fact 
that it is still a relatively novel area that is in such high demand further drove my passion and attracted me to the role.
